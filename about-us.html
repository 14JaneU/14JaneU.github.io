            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <h3>Our Story</h3>
            <p>The Hungry Wolf was born out of a shared passion for health, wellness, and the transformative power of nutrition. In 2019, a group of friends—nutrition enthusiasts, health professionals, and culinary adventurers—came together with a mission to explore the benefits of the carnivore diet. Having personally experienced improved energy, mental clarity, and overall well-being, we felt compelled to share our journey with the world.</p>

    <h3>Why We Started</h3>
    <p>We noticed a gap in accessible, reliable information about the carnivore diet. Misinformation and skepticism often overshadow the potential benefits. Driven by our own positive experiences, we wanted to create a platform where others could learn about this way of eating in a welcoming and supportive environment.</p>
